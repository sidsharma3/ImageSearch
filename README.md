# ImageSearch
This is an iOS app which allows users to take a picture of an object, the app then identifies the object using machine learning and connects to wikipedia to give a description of the object. From here the user can then have the app read the description of the object out loud!



In order to start the app clone the project in Xcode and then create a terminal window and cd into the directory where the cloned project is stored. Run pod install and then connect your iPhone to the project and the application will be ready to use!

Keep in mind project will not work in simulator since it requires camera functionality.
